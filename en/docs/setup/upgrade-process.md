# Upgrading WSO2 Identity Server

Follow this guide to learn about upgrading your WSO2 Identity Server to IS 5.10.0.

## Why upgrade?

You would want to upgrade the WSO2 product to the latest version for multiple reasons. These reasons include but are not limited to the following.

-   The current product version you are using is reaching its end of life. You can verify this from the [WSO2 support matrix](https://wso2.com/products/support-matrix/).
-   You want to leverage the new features of the latest version of the product.
-   Your current product version does not have certain security and bug fixes that you require.

## What has changed

Over the course of its lifetime, WSO2 Identity Server has changed significantly. Some of the features you used in an older version may not work the same way.
