# Invite users from the parent organization

In the business-to-business (B2B) world, sometimes customer or partner organizations may need help with administrative tasks from members of the root organization. There's also a situation where a user from the root organization, who uses a specific application of a customer or partner organization, wants to invite other users from the root organization.

For these situations, we have a feature called "inviting parent organization members." When you invite someone, you can specify which groups they should be a part of. Once they accept the invitation, they'll be added to the organization and placed in the mentioned groups.

To make sure parent organization members have the right level of access, you can give them authorization by assigning their groups to the appropriate roles.

## Prerequisites

Inorder to make an invitation, the username of the parent organization's user should get to know through an offline channel.
