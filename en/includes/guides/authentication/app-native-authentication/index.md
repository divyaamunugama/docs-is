# App-native authentication

App-native authentication is an API-based mechanism that helps developers integrate login flows within an application.

This means that users logging in to the application do not have to be redirected to an external web browser for login resulting in a seamless user experience. As a business, you can leverage app-native authentication to retain users within the application's environment at all times.
